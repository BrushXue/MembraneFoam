Quick Quide 
===========

This test case might not work out-of-the-box on all systems, but should 
give a general idea of how to set up a simulation.

First run ./setup to setup the case appropriately.

Subsequently, load Openfoam, e.g. depending on system:
module load OpenFoam/3.0.1/gcc-5.1.0-openmpi 

Then run the following solver to get a good initial p field
potentialSalt

And then a solver to compute the membrane transport (here steady state):
simpleSaltTransport
